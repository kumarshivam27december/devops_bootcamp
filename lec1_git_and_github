if we don't want to commit and also not want to loose the content 
then we can do 

git add .
git stash


and whenever we wanted it back we can use
git stash pop


and we want to clear it that is permanently delete it we can use
git stash clear


if we want to undo the changes or get back to the particular format before
changing it then we can use
git log
and then how much we want to delete below that one we can copy the log id and
then we can run the command
git reset <log_id>


if we want to remove it from the stage without commiting it then we can use
git restore --staged file.txt


for making a seperate branch to the code base so that code base doesnot fail
we can use
git branch new_feature
git checkout new_feature
this will change the HEAD pointer to the new feature
and will commit it here before checking it
this is acyclic graph data structure



git merge feature //to merge the code so that all can see the commit
